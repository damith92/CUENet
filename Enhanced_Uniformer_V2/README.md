# Enhanced Uniformer V2 Architecture

Follow the installation instructions from https://github.com/OpenGVLab/UniFormerV2/ and set up the repository for Uniformer V2 architecture and then replace the "slowfast" and "tools" folders to incorporate the enhancements to the architecture and also the "exp" folder to see the hyperparameters for our experiments.

The exact enhancements to the Uniformer V2 architecture can be found in the file "slowfast/models/uniformerv2_model.py" with MEAA.
